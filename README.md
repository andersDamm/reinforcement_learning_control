# reinforcement_learning_control
Reinforcement learning for control - Deep Learning DTU


This git is for the project in the course 02456 Deep learning at Technical University of Denmark.
The project deals with reinforcement learning for continuous control of the classical cart-pole system with one and two poles.
Comparison with LQR is made in the project.
The algorithm used for reinforcement learning is the deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG).


What is included in this git:

- Code for training the cart-2-pole
- Creating videoes for trained network
- Creating videoes for cart-1-pole with LQR
- actor_net200 is the fully trained network for cart-1-pole
